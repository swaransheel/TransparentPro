Objective
 Team Assignment: Product Transparency Website
 Build a full-stack web application that collects detailed information about products by asking dynamic
 follow-up questions, stores the data, and generates a Product Transparency Report. The platform should be
 clean, intelligent, and user-friendly.
 Full Stack Developer Responsibilities
 Tech Stack:- Frontend: React + TypeScript- Backend: Node.js (Express or Nest.js)- Database: PostgreSQL (or MongoDB/Firebase optional)
 Tasks:
 1. Design a multi-step form to collect product data with conditional logic.
 2. Build APIs to store product data and fetch it.
 3. Create a backend module to generate a PDF report.
 4. Design database schema for products, questions, and reports.
 5. (Bonus) Add authentication for company access.
 AI/ML Developer Responsibilities
 Goal:
 Make the product data collection smarter using NLP or LLM-based models.
 Tasks:
 1. Generate follow-up questions using pre-trained models (BERT, T5) or LLM APIs.
 2. (Optional) Provide product validation or scoring logic.
 3. Build a Flask or FastAPI service with endpoints:
